##Parkinson's Disease Detection
This repository contains a project focused on detecting Parkinson's disease using machine learning algorithms. The project includes data preprocessing, model training with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest Classifier (RFC), and Support Vector Machines (SVM), and evaluation of their performance.
#Introduction
Present the results of your model training and evaluation. Include metrics used to assess model performance (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) and any insights gained from the results.

#Conclusion
Summarize the findings of your project. Discuss the effectiveness of each model (KNN, RFC, SVM) in detecting Parkinson's disease and any recommendations for future improvements or applications.
