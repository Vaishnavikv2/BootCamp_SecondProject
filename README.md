# BootCamp_SecondProject
Parkinson's Disease Detection
This repository contains a project focused on detecting Parkinson's disease using machine learning algorithms. The project includes data preprocessing, model training with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest Classifier (RFC), and Support Vector Machines (SVM), and evaluation of their performance.

Introduction
This section provides an overview of the project and introduces the key aspects of model training and evaluation.

Presenting Results
Present the results of your model training and evaluation here. Include metrics used to assess model performance such as accuracy, precision, recall, and any other relevant metrics. Provide insights gained from analyzing the results.

Conclusion
Summarize the findings of your project. Discuss the effectiveness of each model (KNN, RFC, SVM) in detecting Parkinson's disease based on the results presented. Include recommendations for future improvements or applications.
